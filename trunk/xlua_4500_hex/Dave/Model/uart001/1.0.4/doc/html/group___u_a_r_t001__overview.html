<h3><a class="anchor" id="UART001_overviewpage"></a>Overview</h3><div class="textblock"><p>USIC_UART_UART001 App provides non re-entrant APIs which allows a higher level App to reserve a USIC channel (configured in UART protocol mode of operation) and use channel for data transfer/receive operations. The App is designed to always use the USIC FIFO, with UI configurations provided to configure the FIFO Size and Trigger Limits. The App also provides UI to configure UART parameters such as Baud Rate, Word Length, Stop Bit and Parity.(Note:For XMC4500, Parity mode cannot be used, see XMC4500 Errata Sheet Rel. 1.0, USIC_AI.007 Table 11) DMA mode is not used by the App to simplify the design. However this feature is provided in UART002 App. The App supports the below modes of operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Full Duplex </li>
<li>
Half Duplex </li>
<li>
Loop Back Mode </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Full Duplex</b> </p>
<p>In Full Duplex communication both transmission and reception can be done simultaneously. To achieve this usecase independent communication line is needed for each transfer direction. UART001 App consumes two IO002 App to achieve full duplex communication. User can do manual pin assignment for each IO002 App based on the connectivity requirement.</p>
<p><b>Half Duplex</b> </p>
<p>In Half Duplex communication a single communication line is shared for both transmission and reception. In this mode UART001 App consumes a single IO002 App. Half duplex mode can be selected if user wants multi-transmitter communication. In this case, user has to take care that only one transmitter is active at a time.</p>
<p>Note: Collision detection is not possible for the XMC45xx/XMC44xx series due hardware limitation. </p>
<p><b>Loop Back Mode</b> </p>
<p>In this mode transmit pin of the allocated USIC channel is connected to receive pin of the same channel <b>internally</b>. Data transmitted by the transmitter can be received by the receiver as if it would have been sent by other communication partner. In this mode no IO002 App is consumed.</p>
<p>The App provides below Macros which provide register base address of mapped USIC Channels. This allows the user to achieve programming at register bit level in use cases which cannot be achieved with UART001 APIs. Below macros are generated in the file <a class="el" href="_u_a_r_t001___conf_8h.html" title="Configuration file generated based on UI settings of UART001 App.">UART001_Conf.h</a>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<em><b>UART001_x_USIC</b></em> - Macro to access Mapped USIC Module Base address of UART001/x App instance. </li>
<li>
<em><b>UART001_x_USIC_CH</b></em> - Macro to access Mapped USIC Channel Base address of UART001/x App instance. </li>
