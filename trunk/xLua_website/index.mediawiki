==Introduction==
xLua is a fork of the project [http://www.eluaproject.net/ eLua]

We would like to foster the adoption of Lua in the Industrial embedded applications.

We performed the following modification:

----
'''Removed almost all peripheral modules'''

: User can interface peripheral specific libraries by [http://www.swig.org Swig]
: (extended by Raman Gopalan to support the specific implementation of eLua xLua).
----
'''Integration with a RTOS''' 

: We think that the most typical use case for Lua is safe execution of user code not interfering with real time process.
: For this reason xLua is executed in lower priority thread of a RTOS in other case a compliant CMSIS RTOS (in our case ARM RTX).
----
'''Implementation for Infineon XMC4500'''

: We ported to Infineon XMC4500 using Dave(tm)3 IDE. However the code is highly portable and we used Dave(tm)3 
: just to generate the low level drivers.
