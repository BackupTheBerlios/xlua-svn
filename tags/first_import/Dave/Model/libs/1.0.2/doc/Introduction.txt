\page CCU8PWMLIB_intropage Introduction
This is a library app and does not provide any UI configurations.
This app only provides APIs. It should not be used standalone as it does not consume
any HW resources which are neede for generating PWM waveforms.
This library is used by PWMSP002 and PWMMP001 app.

\section CCU8PWMLIB_scopesec Scope
This library app provides APIs for PWMSP002 and PWMMP001 app to generate PWM waveforms.
